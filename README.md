# Credit_Risk_Analysis
#### *Utilized Python's imbalance-learn and scikit-learn libraries to predict credit risk using several machine learning models.*

## Overview of Analysis - Supervised Machine Learning

Objective of this project was to use machine learning models to analyze credit risk to provide a more reliable and quicker loan experience. Using these models, good candidates for loans were accurately identified which could efficiently assist financial institutions in decreasing their loan default rates. Several machine learning models were built and evaluated to predict credit risk.
